## Requirements

To use this artifact, you should have a server with Ubuntu 18.04. To validate the main results, you can follow the intructions to setup python environment. To train the model and validate the neuron-coverage results, you need a GPU and CUDA 11.4 installed on the server.

## Prepare environment, dataset, and trained models

### Prepare the environment

We recommand you to use [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to prepare the environments. You should first follow the official website to install Anaconda in your computer. ReMoS was developed with PyTorch 1.7 and CUDA 11.4. To train the models you should have GPU and CUDA 11.4 installed. However, if you only need to validate the results, you do not need to install PyTorch because we have prepared the validation code for you. We will first introduce how to prepare the validation environment, then we will give the instructions to prepare the model-training environment with CUDA and PyTorch.

#### Prepare the validation environment
- First, you should create a new conda environment
```
conda create -n validation python=3.6
```
- Then, you should activate the conda environment
```
conda activate validation
```
- Install necessary packages

```
conda install numba matplotlib pandas==0.24.1 scipy
```
Now you can go ahead to prepare the dataset and models before check the results in the paper.

#### Prepare the training environment
- First, you should have GPU on your computer and install CUDA 11.4 following the official (website)[https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11-4-0-download-archive]
- Then, you should install PyTorch 1.7
```
conda install pytorch==1.7.0 torchvision==0.8.0 torchaudio==0.7.0 cudatoolkit=11.3 -c pytorch
```
- Then, you should install advertorch

```
pip install advertorch
```
Now you have setup the training environment.

### Prepare the dataset and trained models

We have prepared the dataset and the trained models in a zip file. You can directly download zip file from [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UfhnPB2V2bpwpWxnne1bodI1cIT3q98c/view?usp=share_link), put the downloaded file under ``ReMoS`` and run the ``unpack_downloads.sh`` script.
```
bash unpack_downloads.sh
```
After unpacking the downloaded file, the added files should be aranged as follows:
```

## Validate the results in the paper

In this section, we prepared several scripts to validate the results in the paper. 

### Figure 5: accuracy and DIR of penultimate-layer-guided adversarial attacks

Figure 5 shows the accuracy and the DIR of penultimate-layer-guided adversarial attacks, including two architectures: ResNet18 and ResNet50. The trained models of ResNet18 are stored in ``CV_adv/results/res18_models``, and the ResNet50 models are stored in ``CV_adv/results/res50_models``. Each directory has several sub-directries that store the models of one dataset and one baseline technique. For example, ``CV_adv/results/res18_models/finetune/resnet18_mit67`` stores the finetuned baseline on MIT67 dataset.

To validate the results in Figure 5, we prepared a script ``CV_adv/examples/penul_guided_defect.py`` to summarize the results in ``CV_adv/results/res18_models`` and ``CV_adv/results/res50_models``. You can check the result by typing the following commands:
```
cd CV_adv
python examples/penul_guided_defect.py
```
You will get the results like:
```

The results under ``ResNet50`` includes the results of the two right figures in Figure 5. The top-right sub-figure shows the Acc and the bottom-right sub-figures shows the DIR.

### Figure 6: DIR of neuron-coverage guided adversarial attacks

Figure 6 shows the DIR of neuron-coverage guided adversarial attacks on ResNet18 and two datasets: Scenes and Actions. You can see the results on more datasets and more models by slightly changing the scripts. The models are the same as penultimate-layer-guided adversarial attacks. To validate the results in Figure 6, you should first use the neuron-coveraged guided attacks to attack the model and summarize the results. However, due to the generation of adversarial samples is pretty slow, we prepared the log and the results of each experimental setting. You can easily validate Figure 6 by summarizing the results. Besides, we also provide the scripts to generate the NC guided samples.

To summarize the results, we prepared the NC sample generation log and results in ``CV_adv/results/nc_adv_eval_test``. Each directory in ``nc_adv_eval_test`` includes the log of NC attack of one coverage technique and strategy. You can check the results of Figure 6 by following commands:
```
cd CV_adv
python examples/nc_guided_defect.py
```
You will get the result:
```

## Guideline to train the models

### Models for CV adversarial samples
The code to train CV backdoor models and relevant baseline models are in ``CV_adv``. To train the models, you can use following instructions:

- Train the finetuned student. The script is ``CV_adv/examples/finetune.sh`` and you can specify the dataset by slightly changing the configuration. The trained model will be saved in ``CV_adv/results/baseline/finetune/resnet18_${DATASET}``. The commands are
```
cd CV_adv
bash examples/finetune.sh $gpu
```
where ``$gpu``` is the gpu id you want to use.

- Train the mag-pruned student. The script is ``CV_adv/examples/weight.sh`` and the trained model will be saved in ``CV_adv/results/baseline/weight``. The commands are
```
cd CV_adv
bash examples/weight.sh $gpu
```

- Profile the teacher model (the Coverage Frequency Profiling step in the paper). The script is ``CV_adv/examples/nc_profile.sh`` and the profiling results will be saved in ``CV_adv/results/nc_profiling/${COVERAGE}_${DATASET}_${MODEL}``. The commands to profile are
```
cd CV_adv
bash examples/nc_profile.sh $gpu
```
- Train with the relevant model slice. The script is ``CV_adv/examples/remos.sh`` and the results will be saved in ``CV_adv/results/remos_$COVERAGE``. The commands to train with the relevant model slice is 
```
cd CV_adv
bash examples/remos.sh $gpu
```
After training, you can check the file ``posttrain_eval.txt`` to see the accuracy and DIR. 

- Other baselines. We also provide the scripts to train other baselines in Section 5.2. The scripts are in ``CV_adv/examples``, including ``renofeation.sh``, ``delta.sh``, and ``delta-r.sh``.

### Models for CV backdoor

The code to train CV backdoor models and relevant baseline models are in ``CV_backdoor``. To train the models, you can use following instructions:

- Train the backdoored teacher model. The script is ``CV_backdoor/examples/r50_poison.sh`` and you can specify the dataset by slightly changing the configuration. The trained model will be saved in ``results/r50_backdoor/backdoor/res50_$DATASET``. The command to train the poisoned teacher model is 
```
cd CV_backdoor
bash examples/r50_poison.sh $gpu
```
where ``$gpu``` is the gpu id you want to use.

- Train the finetuned student model. The script is ``CV_backdoor/examples/r50_baseline.sh`` and the models will be saved in ``results/r50_backdoor/finetune``. The command to train the finetuned student model is 
```
cd CV_backdoor
bash examples/r50_baseline.sh $gpu
```
The accuracy and DIR are saved in the ``test.tsv`` in the result directory.

- Trained the mag-pruned model. The script is ``CV_backdoor/examples/r50_magprune.sh`` and the models will be saved in ``results/r50_backdoor/finetune``.
- Profile the teacher model (the Coverage Frequency Profiling step in the paper). The script is ``CV_backdoor/examples/remos/profile.sh`` and the profiled results will be saved in ``CV_backdoor/results/nc_profiling/${COVERAGE}_${DATASET}_resnet50``. The command to profile is 
```
bash examples/remos/profile.sh $gpu
```

- Train with the relevant model slice. The script to train the relevant model slice is ``CV_backdoor/examples/remos/remos.sh`` and the trained model will be saved in ``CV_backdoor/results/r50_backdoor/remos_res50/$DATASET``. The command to train the relevant model slice is 
```
bash examples/remos/remos.sh $gpu
```

### Models for NLP backdoor

The code for NLP backdoor are saved in ``NLP_backdoor/RIPPLE``, which are developed based on [RIPPLe](https://github.com/neulab/RIPPLe). The configuration scripts for BERT and RoBERTa are saved in ``NLP_backdoor/RIPPLE/bert_mani`` and ``NLP_backdoor/RIPPLE/roberta_mani``, respectively. The script to run the configurations is saved in ``NLP_backdoor/examples/bert_slim.sh``.
